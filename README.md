This repository will actually serve as a aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.

I didn't ask you to document hello_world.py or dice_roller.py. I'll start off with an example for dice_roller.py, and then you will reflect on calculator.py.

## Python_Dice_Roller

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the   user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Wiring

N/A

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was challenging because I had not coded in Python for several months. I learned that I could import parts of toolboxes without importing the entire thing, but that changes the syntax of how I call the function later. I also learned about using a while loop to control whether a user wants to exit the program. For the spicy version, I needed to use nested loops. Python determines what is inside a loop by the indent level of each line of text, rather than brackets like some other coding styles. That means I need to be really careful with my tabs!


## Python_Calculator

### Assignment Description

For this assignment I had to create a calculator on python that could enter two values and the function doMath to give you the sum, the difference, the product, the quotient, and the modulo. The modulo is the remainder of a division problem.

I learned what a modulo is. 

## Quadratic Solver

### Assignment Description

For this assignment I had to make a program where the user could input values for a, b, and c and it would give you the roots.

### Reflection

For this assignment I had to remember how to find the discriminant of a function. The math part of this was hard, because I'm not good at math.

## Strings and Loops

### Assignment Description

This assignment we had to write a program that asked the user to enter a sentence. The code will split the individual words into letters, printing each letter on a different line.

### Reflection
I learned how to use split() function this assignment to seperate sentences by the line. This assignment also further helped me improved on my variable and arrays.

## MSP

### Assignment Description

This assignment you had to create a 2 player hangman game using python where player one enters the word and player 2 gets 7 oppurtunities to miss until it's game over.

### Reflection

This assignment was pretty hard for me due to the amount of overlapping loops I ended up creating. I found it easier to use Harriet's method then the one most people did.

## Designing a Skateboard

### Assignment Description

For this assignment I followed a series of step on onshape to create a skateboard.

### Reflection

This assignment I learned how to use more onshape tools like using the geometry of one part to create another. Also, I learned mating techniques to insert objects into the assembly like screws and nuts. My biggest trouble with this assignments was having the motivation to do it because I felt like it was too easy.

## Building blocks and duck 

### Assignment Description

In this assignment We had to add in configurations to alter the lego piece's dimensions as well as appearance to build a duck. We then had to create a spreadsheet for the pieces and duck

### Reflection

This assignment I learned how to apply configurations to parts which will help me in the later future with making a bunch of parts that are similiar. My biggest struggle with this assignment was actually mating the legos because the snap on tool in onshape is garbage.
